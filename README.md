# What I learned from this Project.
### Firebase Integration with Authentication and Backend Data Management
When I started this project, my understanding of backend management and integrating it with frontend frameworks was minimal. However, through working with Firebase, I gained valuable learning experiences in handling data interactions. I learned how to send, receive, and update data in Firebase, which allowed me to implement features such as the leaderboard. By incorporating Firebase's authentication, I enabled authenticated users to submit their scores securely.

### TypeScript Proficiency
Before starting this project, I wanted to integrate typescript because I heard very good things about typescript and I thought it would be a very good learning experience. As I delved deeper into this project, I came across various scenarios where TypeScript proved to be a powerful tool for catching potential errors and keeping the code cleaner. Even though I'm still not very comfortable with Typescript, I can confidently say I have grown more comfortable with Typescripit compared to the beginning.
  
### React Libraries
During the development of this project, I discovered the value of utilizing existing React libraries to enhance functionality, user experience and speed up the coding process. One notable example is the implementation of an image magnifier, which allows users to zoom in on specific parts of the image.
